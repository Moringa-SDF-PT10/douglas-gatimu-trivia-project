# Interactive Quiz Game

This project was built to fulfill an end-of-phase project requirement involving DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript. It allows users to test their knowledge through random trivia questions fetched from API endpoint and provides feedback, scoring, and a review option.

## Description

This repository contains a browser-based interactive quiz application that enables users to:

- Start a quiz with a click.
- Answer multiple choice or true/false questions.
- Get immediate feedback on whether their selected answer is correct.
- See their total score after completing all questions.
- Review correct answers for any questions they got wrong.
- Restart the quiz to play again.

**JavaScript concepts used**:

- DOM traversal and manipulation (`querySelector`, `appendChild`, etc.)
- Event listeners and form submission handling
- Dynamic element creation
- Fetch API for getting quiz questions from a public API, https://opentdb.com/api_config.php in this project.
